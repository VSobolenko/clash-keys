## Description

A small arcade game where the player's goal is to safely guide the character across three roads with moving obstacles
and defeat enemies in the final arena.

Features:

- The character spawns at the starting point and must cross three roads with varying obstacle speed and density.
- Colliding with an obstacle respawns the player at the start.
- After crossing the roads, the player fights two enemies. Both victory and defeat are possible.
- Upon victory, enemies disappear and a chest appears.
- The chest can be opened with a miniâ€‘game: drag three matching keys into the lock.
- When the correct keys are placed, the victory screen appears with a message and a restart button.
